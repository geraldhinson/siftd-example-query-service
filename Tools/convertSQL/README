WARNING: That said it might save you some time just from a formatting perspective even in its current form.

This is an experiment to see how well ChatGPT would do at generating a tool that would convert from
a format as used in DBeaver (and similar) to test a query:

    WITH vars AS (
    SELECT
        '126f81a3-7482-4884-8b58-6dba1b209d9a'::VARCHAR AS id,
        'GUID-fake-member-GUID'::varchar AS ownerId
    )
    SELECT *
    FROM public."Resources" r, vars
    WHERE r."Id" = vars.id
    AND r."OwnerId" = vars.ownerId;

to the json format used in the queries files (Queries.json and Public.Queries.json) which looks like this:

    {
    "query": "SELECT * FROM public.\"Resources\" r WHERE r.\"Id\" = {id} AND r.\"OwnerId\" = {ownerId};",
    "queryParameters": [
        {
        "name": "id",
        "type": "STRING"
        },
        {
        "name": "ownerId",
        "type": "STRING"
        }
    ]
    }
